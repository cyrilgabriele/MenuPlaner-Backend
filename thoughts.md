# My Thoughts for the next Steps
## First Phase
In this phase i want to impelemnt the essential fucntionalities to create a MVP
###
- change require() ti import ...
- I need to handle the response to fill into the table => each meal into the corresponding field (= Breakfast-Monday, ...)
- User could make then adjustments => 
- in a next step the (may) altered table gets sent (piecewise) to the LLM and receipies for each meal is done 
- after receipies are saved => needed ingredients are counted up (=> in next phase create a 'Lagerbestand' to see what's available)
- receipies are saved as 'objects' => user can then via drop-down or select or whatever choose meals if pruposed ones does not fit 
- User must authenticate himself (auth0 ?)
- Therefore with the authenitcaiton the user can set some preferences for example: 
    I want to eat always the same breakfast (me for example) or vegetarian, ...
